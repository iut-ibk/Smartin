# Smartin-Toolbox
The Smartin-Toolbox is intened for real-time controlled (RTC) applications in the field of urban water infrastructures. The focus is on the development of network-based applications for urban drainage system (UDS) and water distribution system (WDS) based on SWMM5 and Epanet2. The devoloped programmes so far are:

* Smartin (simulation tool for smart rainwater harvesting in a coupled model of UDS and WDS with detail at household level)
* RTC WDS (under devolpment)

## Requirments
* PySWMM (get the latest version https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/pyswmm/tree/57bcb243ff3a4d9e802060c9590636750df02844)
* Epanet-Modul (https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet-python) (included in this repository)
